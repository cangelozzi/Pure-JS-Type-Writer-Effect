# Pure JavaScript Type Writer Effect
In this project I will create a little website with a type writer effect using pure vanilla JavaScript. 

The type writer effect is build with a Function Constructor and consequently the same code is shown using ES6 Class.

Amazing learning on JS objects, constructor, prototype, ES6 class, DOM manipulation and Flexbox
